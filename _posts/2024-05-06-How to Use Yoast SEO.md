<p>Meta tags play a crucial role in search engine optimization (SEO) by providing search engines with information about your website's content. These tags are snippets of text that describe a page's content and help search engines understand what the page is about. Yoast SEO is a popular WordPress plugin that helps website owners optimize their sites for search engines, including managing meta tags effectively. In this article, we will explore how to harness the power of Yoast SEO for meta tags to boost your website's visibility in search engine results.</p>
<h2>What are Meta Tags in SEO?</h2>
<p>Meta tags are HTML elements that provide information about a webpage for search engines and website visitors.

Meta keywords are a list of keywords or phrases that describe the content of a webpage. By optimizing these meta tags, website owners can improve their site's visibility and ranking in search engine results.</p>
