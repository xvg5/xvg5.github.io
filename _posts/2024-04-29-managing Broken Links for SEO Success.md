<p>In the world of Search Engine Optimization (SEO), broken links can have a significant impact on the success of a website. Broken links, also known as dead links, are hyperlinks that lead to a page that no longer exists or has been moved. These broken links can negatively affect a website's user experience, credibility, and search engine rankings. However, with the use of a broken link checker tool, website owners can easily identify and fix these issues to improve their SEO performance.</p>
<h2>Understanding Broken Links in SEO</h2>

<p>Broken links are an essential aspect of SEO that can harm a website's visibility and ranking in search engine results. When a search engine crawler encounters a broken link on a website, it can negatively impact the website's overall crawlability and indexing. Additionally, broken links can create a poor user experience by leading visitors to error pages, resulting in frustration and a higher bounce rate.</p>
