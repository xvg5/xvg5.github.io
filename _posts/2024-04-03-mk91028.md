<p><strong>What are Google redirect backlinks?</strong>

<p><strong>How does Google decide to redirect backlinks?</strong>
Google employs sophisticated algorithms to analyze and determine the relevance and quality of backlinks.

This redirection aims to enhance user experience and maintain the integrity of search results.</p>
